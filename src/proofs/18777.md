# Minimize Maximum Pair Sum

## Proof

We will first show that the problem statement can be expressed as a greedoid language as defined by Szeszlér (2021) and then show that a simple cost function works for the general greedy algorithm.

We are given an indexed set of natural numbers $\mathbf{N} \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that
$\lvert\mathbf{N}\rvert = 2k$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

Let $S = \{(a,b) : a, b \in I_{\mathbf{N}} \wedge a \neq b\}$ where $I_{\mathbf{N}}$ is the index. Assume without loss of generality that for all $a,b \in S$ we have that $\mathbf{N}_a \leq \mathbf{N}_b$.

Let $S^{*}$ be the set of finite sequences of $S$. Let $\mathscr{L} \subseteq S^{*}$ such that no element of $I_{\mathbf{N}}$ occurs more than once in any sequence in $\mathscr{L}$.

Note that $(S, \mathscr{L})$ defines a greedoid since

- Assume $\alpha \beta \in \mathscr{L}$ . Therefore, $\alpha$ is a word and as such consists of sequences of pairs drawn from $S$. Since $\alpha \beta \in \mathscr{L}$, we know that no element of the indicator set occurs more than once .Therefore, $\alpha$ must also be an element of $\mathscr{L}$ since it is a finite length sequence of pairs with no repeated elements.

- Assume that $\alpha, \beta \in \mathscr{L}$ and $\lvert \alpha \rvert > \lvert \beta \rvert$. Therefore, $\alpha$ must have at least two elements that do not occur in $\beta$ which can form a pair $x$ and thus extend $\beta$. Since $\beta x$ is a finite length sequence of pairs with no repeated elements, $\beta x \in \mathscr{L}$.

Let's define our objective function $w : \mathscr{L} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that:

$$w(\alpha) = -\infty ~\text{if } \alpha = \emptyset \\
w(\alpha) = x + y ~\text{if } \alpha=(x,y) \\
w(\alpha \beta) = max \{w(\alpha), w(\beta) \}$$

Let $\alpha x \in \mathscr{L}$ such that $w(αx) ≤ w(αy)$ for every $y \in \Gamma(\alpha)$.

Note that:

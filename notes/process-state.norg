* Process State

  Every process has a unique integer => PID. Send signal to processes using
  PIDs. 

  Threads require an address space and other resources but can share them among
  other threads.

  -- ( ) Look into variable weight processes.

  [â“˜] Processes cannot share anything without IPC which usually
  involves copying the state from process to process or using an intermediary
  file and mmapping it?
